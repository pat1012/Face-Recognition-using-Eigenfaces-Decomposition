Put all the files under the project debug folder, then run "test.c". It takes about 15 minutes to load "m.txt", "u.txt", and "omega.txt". When the prompt shows up, type test10000.txt or test10001.txt to see the result. These two are the images used for the demo and the original images are 10000.bmp and 10001.bmp in the folder. The result shows the number of a library image which belongs to the same person if correct.
